Indra's Rubies
==============

This project contains my Ruby experiments for exploring the book 
[**Indra's Pearls: The Vision of Felix Klein** 
*by David Mumford, Caroline Series, and David Wright*](http://books.google.com/books?id=XFE3jmSEfC8C)

I started this book a few years ago and tried to explore the ideas in code, but found Java (my language of choice back then) was too obtuse for basic numerical computation tasks like handling Complex numbers. So I gave up. Now I'm revisiting this book. This time, I want to follow through and generate my own computer graphics based on the ideas from the book. Ruby is making things much more pleasant this time around.

My original inspiration for getting the book and exploring these ideas was [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JX3VmDgiFnY)
